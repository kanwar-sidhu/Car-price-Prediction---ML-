Hello welcome to my Repo--

Creating a Machine Learning project for predicting used car prices involves a systematic approach that includes several key steps, from data acquisition and cleaning to model training and evaluation. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a used car based on various features.

 1.Data Acquisition
The first step in any Machine Learning project is to gather the data that will be used.
For a used car price prediction model, this data might include features such as make and model of the 
year , mileage, fuel type, transmission type, power,engine,sellertype,etc. This data can be sourced from
kaggle -https://www.kaggle.com/

2.Data Cleaning
Once the data is collected, it must be cleaned and preprocessed.
>>>  Removing duplicates: Identifying and removing duplicate entries.
>>>  Handling missing values: Imputing or removing data entries with missing values.
>>>  Outlier detection and removal: Identifying and removing outliers that could skew the model's predictions.
>>>  Feature engineering: Creating new features that can help improve model performance

3.Data Visualization
Visualizing the data is crucial for understanding the distribution of variables, spotting outliers,patterns or correlations 
>>>  Histograms for understanding the distribution of numerical features.
>>>  Box plots to detect outliers.
>>>  Scatter plots to observe the relationship between two numerical variables.
>>>  Heatmaps of correlation matrices to identify how features are related to each other and to the target variable (the car's price).>


4. Model Training and Evaluation
With the data cleaned and understood, the next step is to train regression models to predict used car prices.

>>>  Linear Regression: A baseline model where the price is assumed to have a linear relationship with the features.
>>>  Decision Tree Regression: A model that uses a tree-like graph of decisions and their possible consequences.
>>>  Random Forest Regression: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and control overfitting.
>>>  XGBoost: An implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance, which is often effective for structured data like ours.

 For each model, the process involves:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Training the model on the training set.
Hyperparameter tuning to find the best combination of parameters for each model, using techniques like grid search or random search.
Evaluating the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score to assess how well each model performs.
